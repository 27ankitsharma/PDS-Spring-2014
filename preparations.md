Preliminary Material and Preparations
-------------------------------------

Many PDS students will come with no prior experience programming. This is fine- we
will work together to show you what it means to write code and develop software. The
journey from zero to versatile programmer will be long, with many difficulties along
the way. In particular, the first steps up the learning curve will be particularly
steep. With this in mind, I plan on having us taking these steps together. I ask
only that you come to class equipped with the programming tools to get started
on our journey towards becomming a practical data scientist. 

Below are several software systems that we will be using in class. I have given
notes for both Microsoft Windows and Apple OS-X. I will do what I can to help
users with other operating systems, but you'll probably need to do some exploring
on your own. I have installed all the relevant software on my Mac, the instructions
for Windows are slightly less well-tested. If you run into any hiccups or problems
during your install, I advise you to try the first lesson of a practical data
scientist- Google your error messages. Chances are, someone else encountered the 
same problem, and someone likely had a solution to this problem. [Stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com)
is another great resource, a compliation of programming-related questions and answers.
If you've spent 10 minutes looking online and are still stuck, please reach out to me.
I want you to learn how to solve problems, but I don't want you spinning your 
wheels.
