      "Python is what is known as an object-oriented programming language. This means python allows a programmer to define special custom data structures called classes that not only can contain their own data elements, but special fucntions called methods that can potentially alter a class instance's internal state. \n",
      "\n",
      "Classes are defined through the keyword `class`, followed by the name of the class, which, by convention, is capitalized. This is followed by a code block that specifies the methods that define a class. Note that classes are a rich and complex topic in python. However, much of the functionality we will be using throughout this course, in particular, python's machine learning libraries, will be accessed through class objects. Please see the [official documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html) for more info."

      "As mentioned above, classes always have a special function called a constructor that is used to build concrete instances of class objects. A programmer can define their own constructor function, defining any actions that are performed when building a new class object, and data that are used internally within a class object. Like all functions, constructors can take arguments that can be used during their execution. Like methods in a class, the constructor definition takes the special `self` parameter as the left most argument in it's definition. This allows you to modify the internal state of the class object being constructed. Here is an example class with a custom constructor.
